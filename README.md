MatchU is a mobile application designed to help students explore and find their ideal college match! Using variables such as price (user gives a range), location (sort by state or filter by urban / suburban / rural),
school size etc, users can swipe through various profiles as well as filter and search colleges. We utilized FireBase to set up user accounts and store passwords as well as location/price preferences of users,
and formulate lists of saved colleges.
